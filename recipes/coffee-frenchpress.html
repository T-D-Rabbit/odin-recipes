    <h1>Coffee with a French Press!</h1>

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>The French Press is a time-tested technique of brewing coffee. Incredibly forgiving, it provides a rich, deep cup with good extraction.</p>
    <p>The recipe provided here is slightly unorthodox (James Hoffman's method), but is easy to reproduce and reliably produces a good cup of coffee. While most recipes call for coarse ground coffee, this one calls for medium to medium-coarse. Please keep in mind the approximate ratio of 16 ml water to 1 gram coffee, however, you may change this as you see fit.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Coffee grounds - Medium to medium-coarse (Preferably freshly ground!)</li>
        <li>Water</li>
        <li>French Press</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Add grounds to the French Press.</li>
        <li>Add boiling hot water.</li>
        <li>Stir once, then stir again after 20 seconds. Lighter the roast, the more vigorous the stirring.</li>
        <li>Scoop the gunk off the top with a spoon or two.</li>
        <li>Wait 5 minutes</li>
        <li>Put the lid on the press, and lower the plunger only to the top of the coffee being brewed.</li>
        <li>Wait 5 or more minutes. Read the newspaper. Or listen to some music.</li>
        <li>Pour and enjoy.</li>
    </ol>
